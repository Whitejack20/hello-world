This repository is a place to store my ideas, resources and discussions

Welcome to my GitHub, I'm ArtÃªmio :v

Currently, I'm an electrical engineeting graduate student in Unicamp, Brazil.
I'm looking forward to discover new areas and develop new skills before I finish my masters.

Working in progress:
- Github;
  - Trying to register more my projects as I develop them;
- Data Science;
  - As I already have plenty of experience using Python, I'm looking forward more specific things;
- Javascript;
  - JS looks interesting for now... Maybe try learning some back-end?;
- Image and video editing;
  - Just the basics with Photoshop and Filmora;
