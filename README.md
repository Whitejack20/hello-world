Welcome to my GitHub, I'm ArtÃªmio :v

Currently, I'm an electrical engineeting undergraduate student in UFPI, Brazil.
I'm looking forward to discover new areas and develop new skills before I graduate.

Working in progress:
- Excel and VBA;
- Data Science;
- Front-end and Javascript;
- Modeling in Blender (even though my notebook can't stand rendering most stuff hehe);
- Upgrading my notebook (RAM :v);
- Image and video editing (Photoshop? Premiere? Filmora?);
- Explore new tech mods in Minecraft;
