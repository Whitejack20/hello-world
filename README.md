This repository is a place to store my ideas, resources and discussions

Welcome to my GitHub, I'm ArtÃªmio :v

Currently, I'm an electrical engineeting undergraduate student in UFPI, Brazil.
I'm looking forward to discover new areas and develop new skills before I graduate.

Working in progress:
- Excel and VBA;
  - I've learned a lot about Excel in the last years, but VBA is still lacking;
- Data Science
  - Currently learning Python before entering this field;
- Front-end and Javascript;
  - HTML is ok;
  - CSS still stresses me;
  - JS looks interesting for now...;
- Modeling in Blender (even though my notebook can't stand rendering most stuff hehe);
  - Just admiring 3D works looks easier;
- Image and video editing;
  - Just the basics with Photoshop and Filmora;
